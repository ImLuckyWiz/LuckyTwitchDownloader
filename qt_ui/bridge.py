"""Worker threads -> GUI thread.

The tkinter app puts tagged tuples on a queue that ``poll_queue`` empties every 100 ms. Here every message kind
is one typed Qt signal on a ``Bridge``. A worker thread calls ``bridge.<kind>.emit(...)``; the slots run on the
GUI thread (queued connection), so a slot may touch widgets, QPixmap and dialogs.

Rules:
  * Create the Bridge on the GUI thread (a QObject belongs to the thread it was created in).
  * Connect to a method of a QObject that lives on the GUI thread (a widget, the main window): then Qt knows
    which thread the slot must run in. (tests/test_qt_bridge.py also checks that, with PySide6 6.12, a plain
    function or lambda is delivered on the GUI thread too. Prefer methods anyway.)
  * Workers emit plain Python data only. Never hand a widget or a QPixmap to a worker (QImage is fine).
  * "No value" is an empty string where the tkinter message carried None (``tools_done``, ``saved_chat_done``).

The kinds are the ones in PLAN.md section 3.4. The Twitch sign-in dialog has its own messages (code, ok, error,
cancelled); they come with the dialog in Phase 4.
